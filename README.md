Volunteer Experience 

Collaborating with a nutrition laboratory at Cornell University, I assisted in processing and analyzing the data regarding the participants' nutritional intake. Based on the findings and in conjunction with research published by Harvard University, I contributed to the calculation of the Healthy Diet Index for each participant.
